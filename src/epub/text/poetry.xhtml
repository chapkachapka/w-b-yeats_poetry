				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>This book is, in part, a reprint of <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i>, printed a year ago on my sister's hand-press at Dundrum, Co. Dublin. I have not, however, reprinted a play which may be a part of a book of new plays suggested by the dance plays of Japan, and I have added a number of new poems. Michael Robartes and John Aherne, whose names occur in one or other of these, are characters in some stories I wrote years ago, who have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can alone express my convictions about the world. I have the fancy that I read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a disturbance at the first production of "The Play Boy," which may account for his animosity to myself.</p>

				<p>
					<span>The trees are in their autumn beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woodland paths are dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the October twilight the water</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mirrors a still sky;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the brimming water among the stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are nine and fifty swans.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since I first made my count;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, before I had well finished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All suddenly mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scatter wheeling in great broken rings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon their clamorous wings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now my heart is sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first time on this shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bell-beat of their wings above my head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trod with a lighter tread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unwearied still, lover by lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They paddle in the cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companionable streams or climb the air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their hearts have not grown old;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passion or conquest, wander where they will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attend upon them still.</span>

					<span>'What have I earned for all that work,' I said,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The reputation of his lifetime lost</span>

					<span>Between the night and morning. I might have lived,</span>

					<span>Where every day my footfall should have lit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the green shadow of Ferrara wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or climbed among the images of the past—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unperturbed and courtly images—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Evening and morning, the steep street of Urbino</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where the duchess and her people talked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stately midnight through until they stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In their great window looking at the dawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I might have had no friend that could not mix</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Courtesy and passion into one like those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I might have used the one substantial right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trade allows: chosen my company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chosen what scenery had pleased me best.'</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon my phoenix answered in reproof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>'The drunkards, pilferers of public funds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the dishonest crowd I had driven away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When my luck changed and they dared meet my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crawled from obscurity, and set upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those I had served and some that I had fed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet never have I, now nor any time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl3">
						<span>Complained of the people.'</span>

					<span>Was: 'You, that have not lived in thought but deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can have the purity of a natural force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I, whose virtues are the definitions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the analytic mind, can neither close</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech.'</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, because my heart leaped at her words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was abashed, and now they come to mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After nine years, I sink my head abashed.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her unblemished lineaments, a whiteness with no stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there's a score of duchesses, surpassing womankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind:</span>

				<p>
					<span>The young men every night applaud their Gaby's laughing eye,</span>

					<span>And Ruth St. Denis had more charm although she had poor luck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova's had the cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there's a player in the States who gathers up her cloak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all a woman's passion, a child's imperious way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there are—but no matter if there are scores beside:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There's Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One's had her fill of lovers, another's had but one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another boasts, 'I pick and choose and have but two or three.'</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If head and limb have beauty and the instep's high and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be but the breakers of men's hearts or engines of delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There'll be that crowd to make men wild through all the centuries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And maybe there'll be some young belle walk out to make men wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is my beauty's equal, though that my heart denies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not the exact likeness, the simplicity of a child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray,</span>

					<span>You are more beautiful than any one</span>

					<span>And I am afraid that you will run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And paddle to the wrist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that mysterious, always brimming lake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where those that have obeyed the holy law</span>

					<span>Paddle and are perfect; leave unchanged</span>

					<span>To scatter the Acacia spray</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Many a son and daughter lies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far from the customary skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Mall and Eades's grammar school,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In London or in Liverpool;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But where is laid the sailor John?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That so many lands had known:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quiet lands or unquiet seas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the Indians trade or Japanese.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A humorous, unambitious man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was buried near the astrologer;</span>

					<span>For wander and wail as he would</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pure cold light in the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Troubled his animal blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Minnaloushe runs in the grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lifting his delicate feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When two close kindred meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What better than call a dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maybe the moon may learn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tired of that courtly fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A new dance turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From moonlit place to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacred moon overhead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has taken a new phase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will pass from change to change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that from round to crescent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From crescent to round they range?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone, important and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lifts to the changing moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His changing eyes.</span>

						<span>On the grey rock of Cashel I suddenly saw</span>

						<span>A Sphinx with woman breast and lion paw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Buddha, hand at rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hand lifted up that blest;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And right between these two a girl at play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it may be had danced her life away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now being dead it seemed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she of dancing dreamed.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Although I saw it all in the mind's eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There can be nothing solider till I die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw by the moon's light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now at its fifteenth night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In triumph of intellect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With motionless head erect.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet little peace he had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For those that love are sad.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Oh, little did they care who danced between,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And little she by whom her dance was seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So that she danced. No thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Body perfection brought,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For what but eye and ear silence the mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the minute particulars of mankind?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mind moved yet seemed to stop</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As 'twere a spinning-top.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In contemplation had those three so wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a moment, and so stretched it out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they, time overthrown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dead yet flesh and bone.</span>
