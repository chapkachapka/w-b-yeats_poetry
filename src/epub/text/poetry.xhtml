									<span>Of many a figured embroidery;</span>

									<span>“Why do you wind no horn?” she said.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“And every hero droop his head?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hornless deer is not more sad</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That many a peaceful moment had,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More sleek than any granary mouse,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In his own leafy forest house</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Among the waving fields of fern:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hunting of heroes should be glad.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O pleasant maiden,” answered Finn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“We think on Oscar’s pencilled urn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And on the heroes lying slain,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On Gavra’s raven-covered plain;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But where are your noble kith and kin,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And into what country do you ride?”</span>

									<span>Aengus and Edain, and my name</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is Niamh, and my land where tide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sleep drown sun and moon and star.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>

									<br/>
									<span>To this dim shore on foam-wet feet?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did your companion wander away</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From where the birds of Aengus wing?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She said, with laughter tender and sweet:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“I have not yet, war-weary king,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Been spoken of with any one;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For love of Oisin foam-wet feet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have borne me where the tempests blind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your mortal shores till time is done!”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“How comes it, princess, that your mind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Among undying people has run</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On this young man, Oisin, my son?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“I loved no man, though kings besought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And many a man of lofty name,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until the Danaan poets came,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bringing me honeyed, wandering thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of noble Oisin and his fame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of battles broken by his hands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of stories builded by his words</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That are like coloured Asian birds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At evening in their rainless lands.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>O Patric, by your brazen bell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There was no limb of mine but fell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into a desperate gulph of love!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“You only will I wed,” I cried,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“And I will make a thousand songs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And set your name all names above,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And captives bound with leathern thongs</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall kneel and praise you, one by one,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At evening in my western dun.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O Oisin, mount by me and ride</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To shores by the wash of the tremulous tide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where men have heaped no burial mounds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the days pass by like a wayward tune,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where broken faith has never been known,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the blushes of first love never have flown;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And there I will give you a hundred hounds;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No mightier creatures bay at the moon;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a hundred robes of murmuring silk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a hundred calves and a hundred sheep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a hundred spears and a hundred bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And oil and wine and honey and milk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And always never-anxious sleep;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While a hundred youths, mighty of limb,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a hundred maidens, merry as birds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who when they dance to a fitful measure</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall follow your horn and obey your whim,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And you shall know the Danaan leisure:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Niamh be with you for a wife.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then she sighed gently, “It grows late,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Music and love and sleep await,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where I would be when the white moon climbs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The red sun falls, and the world grows dim.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And then I mounted and she bound me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With her triumphing arms around me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And whispering to herself enwound me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when the horse had felt my weight,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He shook himself and neighed three times:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Caolte, Conan, and Finn came near,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wept, and raised their lamenting hands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bid me stay, with many a tear;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But we rode out from the human lands.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>In what far kingdom do you go,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, Fenians, with the shield and bow?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or are you phantoms white as snow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose lips had life’s most prosperous glow?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O you, with whom in sloping valleys,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or down the dewy forest alleys,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I chased at morn the flying deer,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With whom I hurled the hurrying spear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And heard the foemen’s bucklers rattle,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And broke the heaving ranks of battle!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where are you with your long rough hair?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You go not where the red deer feeds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor tear the foemen from their steeds.</span>

									<span>We galloped over the glossy sea:</span>

									<span>I know not if days passed or hours,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Niamh sang continually</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Danaan songs, and their dewy showers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of pensive laughter, unhuman sound,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lulled weariness, and softly round</span>

									<span>My human sorrow her white arms wound.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>On! on! and now a hornless deer</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Passed by us, chased by a phantom hound</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All pearly white, save one red ear;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now a maiden rode like the wind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With an apple of gold in her tossing hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with quenchless eyes and fluttering hair</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beautiful young man followed behind.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Were these two born in the Danaan land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or have they breathed the mortal air?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>

									<br/>
									<span>Of one long finger on my lip.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But now the moon like a white rose shone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the pale west, and the sun’s rim sank,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And clouds arrayed their rank on rank</span>
									<br/>
									<span>About his fading crimson ball:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The floor of Emen’s hosting hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was not more level than the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As full of loving phantasy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with low murmurs we rode on,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where many a trumpet-twisted shell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That in immortal silence sleeps</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dreaming of her own melting hues,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Her golds, her ambers, and her blues,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now a wandering land breeze came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a far sound of feathery quires;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It seemed to blow from the dying flame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The horse towards the music raced,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Neighing along the lifeless waste;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like sooty fingers, many a tree</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rose ever out of the warm sea;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And they were trembling ceaselessly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though they all were beating time,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the centre of the sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To that low laughing woodland rhyme.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, now our wandering hours were done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We cantered to the shore, and knew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The reason of the trembling trees:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Round every branch the song-birds flew,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or clung thereon like swarming bees;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While round the shore a million stood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drops of frozen rainbow light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pondered in a soft vain mood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon their shadows in the tide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And told the purple deeps their pride,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And murmured snatches of delight;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And on the shores were many boats</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bending sterns and bending bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And carven figures on their prows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And swans with their exultant throats:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And where the wood and waters meet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We tied the horse in a leafy clump,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Niamh blew three merry notes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of a little silver trump;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then an answering whisper flew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Over the bare and woody land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A whisper of impetuous feet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ever nearer, nearer grew;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And from the woods rushed out a band</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of men and maidens, hand in hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And singing, singing altogether;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their brows were white as fragrant milk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their cloaks made out of yellow silk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And trimmed with many a crimson feather:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when they saw the cloak I wore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was dim with mire of a mortal shore,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They fingered it and gazed on me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And laughed like murmurs of the sea;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But Niamh with a swift distress</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bid them away and hold their peace;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when they heard her voice they ran</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And knelt them, every maid and man,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And kissed, as they would never cease,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She bade them bring us to the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A Druid dream of the end of days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the stars are to wane and the world be done.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>They led us by long and shadowy ways</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where drops of dew in myriads fall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tangled creepers every hour</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Blossom in some new crimson flower,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once a sudden laughter sprang</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From all their lips, and once they sang</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Together, while the dark woods rang,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And made in all their distant parts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With boom of bees in honey marts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A rumour of delighted hearts.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once a maiden by my side</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gave me a harp, and bid me sing,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And touch the laughing silver string;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when I sang of human joy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sorrow wrapped each merry face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, Patric! by your beard, they wept,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until one came, a tearful boy;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“A sadder creature never stept</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than this strange human bard,” he cried;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And caught the silver harp away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, weeping over the white strings, hurled</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It down in a leaf-hid hollow place</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That kept dim waters from the sky;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And each one said with a long, long sigh,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“O saddest harp in all the world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And now still sad we came to where</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beautiful young man dreamed within</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A house of wattles, clay, and skin;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One hand upheld his beardless chin,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And one a sceptre flashing out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wild flames of red and gold and blue,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like to a merry wandering rout</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of dancers leaping in the air;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And men and maidens knelt them there</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And showed their eyes with teardrops dim,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with low murmurs prayed to him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And kissed the sceptre with red lips,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And touched it with their finger-tips.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>He held that flashing sceptre up.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Joy drowns the twilight in the dew,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And fills with stars night’s purple cup,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wakes the sluggard seeds of corn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stirs the young kid’s budding horn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes the infant ferns unwrap,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And for the peewit paints his cap,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And rolls along the unwieldy sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes the little planets run:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if joy were not on the earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There were an end of change and birth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And earth and heaven and hell would die,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in some gloomy barrow lie</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Folded like a frozen fly;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then mock at Death and Time with glances</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And waving arms and wandering dances.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Men’s hearts of old were drops of flame</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That from the saffron morning came,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or drops of silver joy that fell</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of the moon’s pale twisted shell;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now hearts cry that hearts are slaves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And toss and turn in narrow caves;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But here there is nor law nor rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor have hands held a weary tool;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And here there is nor Change nor Death,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But only kind and merry breath,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For joy is God and God is joy.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With one long glance on maid and boy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the pale blossom of the moon,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He fell into a Druid swoon.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And in a wild and sudden dance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We mocked at Time and Fate and Chance,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And swept out of the wattled hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And came to where the dewdrops fall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Among the foamdrops of the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And there we hushed the revelry;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, gathering on our brows a frown,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bent all our swaying bodies down,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And to the waves that glimmer by</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That slooping green De Danaan sod</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sang, “God is joy and joy is God,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And things that have grown sad are wicked,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And things that fear the dawn of the morrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>We danced to where in the winding thicket</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The damask roses, bloom on bloom,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bending over them softly said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bending over them in the dance,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a swift and friendly glance</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From dewy eyes: “Upon the dead</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fall the leaves of other roses,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the dead dim earth encloses:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But never, never on our graves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Heaped beside the glimmering waves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall fall the leaves of damask roses.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For neither Death nor Change comes near us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all listless hours fear us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And we fear no dawning morrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The dance wound through the windless woods;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The ever-summered solitudes;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until the tossing arms grew still</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the woody central hill;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, gathered in a panting band,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We flung on high each waving hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sang unto the starry broods:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In our raised eyes there flashed a glow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of milky brightness to and fro</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As thus our song arose: “You stars,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Across your wandering ruby cars</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He rules you with an iron rod,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He holds you with an iron bond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each one woven to the other,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each one woven to his brother</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like bubbles in a frozen pond;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But we in a lonely land abide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unchainable as the dim tide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hearts that know nor law nor rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hands that hold no wearisome tool;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Folded in love that fears no morrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I chased upon that woody shore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The deer, the badger, and the boar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At evening on the glimmering sands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beside the piled-up hunting spears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These now outworn and withered hands</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wrestled among the island bands.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We went a-fishing in long boats</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bending sterns and bending bows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And carven figures on their prows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of bitterns and fish-eating stoats.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O Patric! for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The gentle Niamh was my wife;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But now two things devour my life;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The things that most of all I hate:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fasting and prayers.</span>

									<span>For these were ancient Oisin’s fate</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Loosed long ago from heaven’s gate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For his last days to lie in wait.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>When one day by the shore I stood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I drew out of the numberless</span>
									<br/>
									<span>White flowers of the foam a staff of wood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From some dead warrior’s broken lance:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I turned it in my hands; the stains</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of war were on it, and I wept,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering how the Fenians stept</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Along the blood-bedabbled plains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Equal to good or grievous chance:</span>

									<span>Save only many times my name,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In murmurs, like a frighted bird.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We passed by woods, and lawns of clover,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And found the horse and bridled him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For we knew well the old was over.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I heard one say “his eyes grow dim</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With all the ancient sorrow of men”;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wrapped in dreams rode out again</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hoofs of the pale findrinny</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Over the glimmering purple sea:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the golden evening light.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The immortals moved among the fountains</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By rivers and the woods’ old night;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some danced like shadows on the mountains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some wandered ever hand in hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or sat in dreams on the pale strand;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Each forehead like an obscure star</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bent down above each hooked knee:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sang, and with a dreamy gaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was slumbering half in the sea ways;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, as they sang, the painted birds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Kept time with their bright wings and feet;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drops of honey came their words,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But fainter than a young lamb’s bleat.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“An old man stirs the fire to a blaze,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He has over-lingered his welcome; the days,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He hears the storm in the chimney above,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While his heart still dreams of battle and love,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“But we are apart in the grassy places,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where care cannot trouble the least of our days,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or the softness of youth be gone from our faces,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or love’s first tenderness die in our gaze.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hare grows old as she plays in the sun</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And gazes around her with eyes of brightness;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She limps along in an aged whiteness;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A storm of birds in the Asian trees</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like tulips in the air a-winging,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the gentle waves of the summer seas,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That raise their heads and wander singing,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must murmur at last ‘unjust, unjust’;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ‘my speed is a weariness,’ falters the mouse;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When God shall come from the sea with a sigh</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bid the stars drop down from the sky,</span>
									<br/>

									<span>Now, man of croziers, shadows called our names</span>

									<span>The youth and lady and the deer and hound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Gaze no more on the phantoms,” Niamh said,</span>

									<span>Before God was or my old line began;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Rolled round with music of the sighing spray:</span>

									<span>But sang no more, as when, like a brown bee</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With me in her white arms a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before this day; for now the fall of tears</span>
									<br/>
									<span class="dl3">
										<span>Troubled her song.</span>
										<span> </span>
										<span>I do not know if days</span>
									</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shone many times among the glimmering flowers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wove in her flower-like hair, before dark towers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>About them; and the horse of faery screamed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor ceased until white Niamh stroked his ears</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And named him by sweet names.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">A foaming tide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Burst from a great door marred by many a blow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When gods and giants warred. We rode between</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The seaweed-covered pillars, and the green</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And surging phosphorus alone gave light</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On our dark pathway, till a countless flight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The imaged meteors had flashed and run</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And had disported in the stilly jet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The stream churned, churned, and churned—his lips apart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though he told his never slumbering heart</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of every foamdrop on its misty way:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stairs</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hung from the morning star; when these mild words</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“My brothers spring out of their beds at morn,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They chase the noon-tide deer;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A larch-wood hunting spear.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shores the froth lips wet:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stay a little while, and bid them weep:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, touch their blue veined eyelids if they sleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shake their coverlet.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“When you have told how I weep endlessly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And home to me again,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the shadow of my hair lie hid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tell me how you came to one unbid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The saddest of all men.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>A maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As any ruddy moth, looked down on us;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To two old eagles, full of ancient pride,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That with dim eyeballs stood on either side.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For their dim minds were with the ancient things.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“I bring deliverance,” pearl-pale Niamh said.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My enemy and hope; demons for fright</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Jabber and scream about him in the night;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For he is strong and crafty as the seas</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I must needs endure and hate and weep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until the gods and demons drop asleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Is he so dreadful?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">“Be not over-bold,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But flee while you may flee from him.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">Then I:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“This demon shall be pierced and drop and die,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Flee from him,” pearl-pale Niamh weeping cried,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“For all men flee the demons”; but moved not,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor shook my firm and spacious soul one jot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There was no mightier soul of Heber’s line;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now it is old and mouse-like: for a sign</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I burst the chain: still earless, nerveless, blind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In some dim memory or ancient mood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Still earless, nerveless, blind, the eagles stood.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And then we climbed the stair to a high door,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beneath had paced content: we held our way</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And stood within: clothed in a misty ray</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the roof, and with a straining throat</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no man’s cry shall ever mount so far;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not even your God could have thrown down that hall;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As though His hour were come.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">We sought the part</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That was most distant from the door; green slime</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Made the way slippery, and time on time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Showed prints of sea-born scales, while down through it</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The captives’ journeys to and fro were writ</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like a small river, and, where feet touched, came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the deepest shadows of the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That maiden found a ring hung on the wall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the ring a torch, and with its flare</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Making a world about her in the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Passed under a dim doorway, out of sight,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And came again, holding a second light</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Burning between her fingers, and in mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No centuries could dim: and a word ran</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thereon in Ogham letters, “Mananan”:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That sea-god’s name, who in a deep content</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of the seven-fold seas, built the dark hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The mightier masters of a mightier race;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And at his cry there came no milk-pale face</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But only exultant faces.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">Niamh stood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With bowed head, trembling when the white blade shone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But she whose hours of tenderness were gone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the shadows till the tumults died</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of the loud crashing and earth-shaking fight,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And thrust the torch between the slimy flags.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A dome made out of endless carven jags,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Looked down on me; and in the self-same place</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I waited hour by hour, and the high dome</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was loaded with the memory of days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Buried and mighty: when through the great door</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And found a door deep sunken in the wall,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A little runnel made a bubbling strain,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And on the runnel’s stony and bare edge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A dusky demon dry as a withered sedge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a sad revelry he sang and swung</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His hand along the runnel’s side, as though</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The flowers still grew there: far on the sea’s waste;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A demon’s leisure: eyes, first white, now burned</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Barking. We trampled up and down with blows</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when at withering of the sun he knew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Druid sword of Mananan, he grew</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I but held a corpse, with livid chop</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And dripping and sunken shape, to face and breast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When I tore down that tree; but when the west</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Surged up in plumy fire, I lunged and drave</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Through heart and spine, and cast him in the wave,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lest Niamh shudder.</span>

									<span class="dlx">Full of hope and dread</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea-shine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when the sun once more in saffron stept,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We sang the loves and angers without sleep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all the exultant labours of the strong:</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But now the lying clerics murder song</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With barren words and flatteries of the weak.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In what land do the powerless turn the beak</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For all your croziers, they have left the path</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wander in the storms and clinging snows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hopeless for ever: ancient Oisin knows,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the anvil of the world.</span>

									<span>Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Fenian horses; armour torn asunder;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laughter and cries: the armies clash and shock;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All is done now; I see the ravens flock;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, cease, you mournful, laughing Fenian horn!</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I found, dropping sea-foam on the wide stair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That demon dull and unsubduable;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And once more to a day-long battle fell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And at the sundown threw him in the surge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His new healed shape: and for a hundred years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So warred, so feasted, with nor dreams, nor fears</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor languor nor fatigue: an endless feast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An endless war.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">The hundred years had ceased;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I stood upon the stair: the surges bore</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beech bough to me, and my heart grew sore,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering how I stood by white-haired Finn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While the woodpecker made a merry din,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hare leaped in the grass.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">Young Niamh came</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Holding that horse, and sadly called my name;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I mounted, and we passed over the lone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And drifting grayness, while this monotone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Surly and distant, mixed inseparably</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into the clangour of the wind and sea:</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“I hear my soul drop down into decay,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Mananan’s dark tower, stone by stone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gather sea-slime and fall the seaward way,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the moon goad the waters night and day,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That all be overthrown.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“But till the moon has taken all, I wage</span>
									<br/>
									<span>War on the mightiest men under the skies,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And they have fallen or fled, age after age:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Light is man’s love, and lighter is man’s rage;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His purpose drifts and dies.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And then lost Niamh murmured, “Love, we go</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Islands of Dancing and of Victories</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are empty of all power.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="dlx">“And which of these</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is the Island of Content?”</span>
								</p>

									<span>Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>High as the saddle girth, covering away from our glances the tide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-pale distance broke;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces, and sighed.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And never a song sang Niamh, and over my finger-tips</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-cold air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of lips.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Were we days long or hours long in riding, when rolled in a grisly peace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And we stood on a sea’s edge we saw not; for whiter than new-washed fleece</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And we rode on the plains of the sea’s edge; the sea’s edge barren and gray,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gray sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their wrinkling bark;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that one sound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in the dark:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the ground.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world and the sun,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was one.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems of the hazel and oak,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the long grass lay,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumbering folk,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and shield and blade;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of three years old</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could sleep on a bed of rushes, and all inwrought and inlaid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And each of the huge white creatures was huger than four-score men;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were the claws of birds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The breathing came from those bodies, long-warless, grown whiter than curds.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The wood was so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from His dew-cumbered skies;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests in their locks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in the soft star-flame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lay loose in a place of shadow: we drew the reins by his side.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Golden the nails of his bird-claws, flung loosely along the dim ground;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In one was a branch soft-shining, with bells more many than sighs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In midst of an old man’s bosom; owls ruffling and pacing around,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sidled their bodies against him, filling the shade with their eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And my gaze was thronged with the sleepers; for nowhere in any clann</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of the high people of Soraca nor in glamour by demons flung,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are faces alive with such beauty made known to the salt eye of man,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet weary with passions that faded when the sevenfold seas were young.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And I gazed on the bell-branch, sleep’s forebear, far sung by the Sennachies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw how those slumberers, grown weary, there camping in grasses deep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of the wandering seas,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Laid hands on the bell-branch and swayed it, and fed of unhuman sleep.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Snatching the horn of Niamh, I blew a lingering note;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came sound from those monstrous sleepers, a sound like the stirring of flies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He, shaking the fold of his lips, and heaving the pillar of his throat,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of his eyes.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I cried, “Come out of the shadow, king of the nails of gold!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tell of your goodly household and the goodly works of your hands,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That we may muse in the starlight and talk of the battles of old;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your questioner, Oisin, is worthy, he comes from the Fenian lands.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Half open his eyes were, and held me, dull with the smoke of their dreams;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His lips moved slowly in answer, no answer out of them came;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then he swayed in his fingers the bell-branch, slow dropping a sound in faint streams</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Softer than snow-flakes in April and piercing the marrow like flame.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Wrapt in the wave of that music, with weariness more than of earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The moil of my centuries filled me; and gone like a sea-covered stone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the memories of the whole of my mirth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a softness came from the starlight and filled me full to the bone.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>In the roots of the grasses, the sorrels, I laid my body as low;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the pearl-pale Niamh lay by me, her brow on the midst of my breast;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the horse was gone in the distance, and years after years ’gan flow;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Square leaves of the ivy moved over us, binding us down to our rest.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the fetlocks drip blood in the battle, when the fallen on fallen lie rolled;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of the heron’s plot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for Midhir of old.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That the spearshaft is made out of ashwood, the shield out of osier and hide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the hammers spring on the anvil, on the spear-head’s burning spot;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How the slow, blue-eyed oxen of Finn low sadly at evening tide.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>But in dreams, mild man of the croziers, driving the dust with their throngs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Moved round me, of seamen or landsmen, all who are winter tales;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came by me the Kings of the Red Branch, with roaring of laughter and songs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or moved as they moved once, love-making or piercing the tempest with sails.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Came Blanid, MacNessa, tall Fergus who feastward of old time slunk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cook Barach, the traitor; and warward, the spittle on his beard never dry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dark Balor, as old as a forest, car-borne, his mighty head sunk</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Helpless, men lifting the lids of his weary and death-making eye.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And by me, in soft red raiment, the Fenians moved in loud streams,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Grania, walking and smiling, sewed with her needle of bone.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So lived I and lived not, so wrought I and wrought not, with creatures of dreams,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a long iron sleep, as a fish in the water goes dumb as a stone.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>At times our slumber was lightened. When the sun was on silver or gold;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When brushed with the wings of the owls, in the dimness they love going by;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When a glow-worm was green on a grass leaf lured from his lair in the mould;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Half wakening, we lifted our eyelids, and gazed on the grass with a sigh.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>So watched I when, man of the croziers, at the heel of a century fell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Weak, in the midst of the meadow, from his miles in the midst of the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A starling like them that forgathered ’neath a moon waking white as a shell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the Fenians made foray at morning with Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I awoke: the strange horse without summons out of the distance ran,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his bosom deep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that I would leave the immortals, their dimness, their dews dropping sleep.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>O, had you seen beautiful Niamh grow white as the waters are white,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lord of the croziers, you even had lifted your hands and wept:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, the bird in my fingers, I mounted, remembering alone that delight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of twilight and slumber were gone, and that hoofs impatiently stept.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I cried, “O Niamh! O white one! if only a twelve-houred day,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I must gaze on the beard of Finn, and move where the old men and young</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the Fenians’ dwellings of wattle lean on the chessboards and play,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, sweet to me now were even bald Conan’s slanderous tongue!</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Like me were some galley forsaken far off in Meridian isle,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remembering its long-oared companions, sails turning to thread-bare rags;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes and flags.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with mysterious thought,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Watched her those seamless faces from the valley’s glimmering girth;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As she murmured, “O wandering Oisin, the strength of the bell-branch is naught,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sadness of earth.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“Then go through the lands in the saddle and see what the mortals do,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And softly come to your Niamh over the tops of the tide;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But weep for your Niamh, O Oisin, weep; for if only your shoe</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brush lightly as haymouse earth pebbles, you will come no more to my side.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw from a distant saddle; from the earth she made her moan;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“I would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn, for breast unto breast</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We shall mingle no more, nor our gazes empty their sweetness lone</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>“In the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon who sleeps on her nest,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor lost in the star-fires and odours the sound of the sea’s vague drum,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>The wailing grew distant; I rode by the woods of the wrinkling bark,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where ever is murmurous dropping, old silence and that one sound;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For no live creatures live there, no weasels move in the dark;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a reverie forgetful of all things, over the bubbling ground.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And I rode by the plains of the sea’s edge, where all is barren and gray,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gray sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And the winds made the sands on the sea’s edge turning and turning go,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As my mind made the names of the Fenians. Far from the hazel and oak</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I rode away on the surges, where, high as the saddle bow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fled foam underneath me, and round me, a wandering and milky smoke.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Snatching the bird in secret; nor knew I, embosomed apart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my heart.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell down;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-weeds brown.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>If I were as I once was, the strong hoofs crushing the sand and the shells,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Coming out of the sea as the dawn comes, a chaunt of love on my lips,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the bells,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I would leave no saint’s head on his body from Rachlin to Bera of ships.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and woodwork made,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a small and feeble race stooping with mattock and spade.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Or weeding or ploughing with faces a-shining with much-toil wet;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While in this place and that place, with bodies unglorious, their chieftains stood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Awaiting in patience the straw-death, croziered one, caught in their net:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring of wind in a wood.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And because I went by them so huge and so speedy with eyes so bright,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came after the hard gaze of youth, or an old man lifted his head:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I rode and I rode, and I cried out, “The Fenians hunt wolves in the night,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So sleep they by daytime.” A voice cried, “The Fenians a long time are dead.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>A whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway, the flesh of his face as dried grass,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in folds round his eyes and his mouth, he sad as a child without milk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the dreams of the islands were gone, and I knew how men sorrow and pass,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And their hound, and their horse, and their love, and their eyes that glimmer like silk.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And wrapping my face in my hair, I murmured, “In old age they ceased”;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And my tears were larger than berries, and I murmured, “Where white clouds lie spread</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old they feast</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On the floors of the gods.” He cried, “No, the gods a long time are dead.”</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And lonely and longing for Niamh, I shivered and turned me about,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into her heart;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I turned and rode to the westward, and followed the sea’s old shout</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till I saw where Maeve lies sleeping till starlight and midnight part.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a sack full of sand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They bore it with staggering and sweating, but fell with their burden at length:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Leaning down from the gem-studded saddle, I flung it five yards with my hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With a sob for men waxing so weakly, a sob for the Fenians’ old strength.</span>
								</p>
								<p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A man came slowly from the setting sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Forgail’s daughter, Emer, in her dun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, casting aside his draggled hair:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour-hid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now my years of watching are no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Emer cast the web upon the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stretching out her arms, red with the dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Not any god alive, nor mortal dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has slain so mighty armies, so great kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor won the gold that now Cuchulain brings.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Why do you tremble thus from feet to crown?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Aleel, the swineherd, wept and cast him down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the web-heaped floor, and thus his word:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“With him is one sweet-throated like a bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lovelier than the moon upon the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made for her an army cease to be.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Who bade you tell these things?” and then she cried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To those about, “Beat him with thongs of hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drive him from the door.” And thus it was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And called out to him, “Son, it is not meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you stay idling here with flocks and herds.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I have long waited, mother, for those words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wherefore now?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dlx">“There is a man to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You have the heaviest arm under the sky.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My father dwells among the sea-worn bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And breaks the ridge of battle with his hands.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, you are taller than Cuchulain, son.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He is the mightiest man in ship or dun.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, he is old and sad with many wars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weary of the crash of battle cars.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I only ask what way my journey lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God, who made you bitter, made you wise.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Red Branch kings a tireless banquet keep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the sun falls into the Western deep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go there, and dwell on the green forest rim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell alone your name and house to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose blade compels, and bid them send you one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who has a like vow from their triple dun.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Between the lavish shelter of a wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the gray tide, the Red Branch multitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feasted, and with them old Cuchulain dwelt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his young dear one close beside him knelt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More mournful than the depth of starry skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pondered on the wonder of his days;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all around the harp-string told his praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Conchubar, the Red Branch king of kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last Cuchulain spake, “A young man strays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Driving the deer along the woody ways.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I often hear him singing to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I often hear the sweet sound of his bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek out what man he is.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dlx">One went and came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He bade me let all know he gives his name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the sword point, and bade me bring him one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had a like vow from our triple dun.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I only of the Red Branch hosted now,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cuchulain cried, “have made and keep that vow.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After short fighting in the leafy shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake to the young man, “Is there no maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you come here to meet this ancient sword?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The dooms of men are in God’s hidden hoard.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Your head a while seemed like a woman’s head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I loved once.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dlx">Again the fighting sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the other’s shield his long blade broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pierced him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dlx">“Speak before your breath is done.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I am Finmole, mighty Cuchulain’s son.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I put you from your pain. I can no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While day its burden on to evening bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spake thus, “Cuchulain will dwell there and brood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For three days more in dreadful quietude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then arise, and raving slay us all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, cast on him delusions magical,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ten by ten under a quicken tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tall wands of alder and white quicken wands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In three days’ time, Cuchulain with a moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood up, and came to the long sands alone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For four days warred he with the bitter tide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the waves flowed above him, and he died.</span>

					<span>And sang how day a Druid twilight sheds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a dim, green, well-beloved isle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where people love beside star-laden seas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Time may never mar their faery vows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the woven roofs of quicken boughs:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But while he passed before a plashy place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lug-worm with its gray and muddy mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang how somewhere to north or west or south</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwelt a gay, exulting, gentle race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how beneath those three times blessed skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as it falls awakens leafy tunes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that singing he was no more wise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He mused beside the well of Scanavin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mused upon his mockers: without fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sudden vengeance were a country tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that deep earth has drunk his body in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one small knot-grass growing by the pool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told where, ah, little, all-unneeded voice!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old Silence bids a lonely folk rejoice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chaplet their calm brows with leafage cool;</span>

					<span>And how, when fades the sea-strewn rose of day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their trouble dies into its peace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tale drove his fine angry mood away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He slept under the hill of Lugnagall;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A-telling with their low and reedy cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of how God leans His hands out of the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bless that isle with honey in His tones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none may feel the power of squall and wave,</span>

					<span>For half his flock were in their beds,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Once, while he nodded on a chair,</span>

					<span>From joy the holy branches start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the trembling flowers they bear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The changing colours of its fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have dowered the stars with merry light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The surety of its hidden root</span>

					<span>Has planted quiet in the night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shaking of its leafy head</span>

					<span>Has given the waves their melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made my lips and music wed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring a wizard song for thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, through bewildered branches, go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tossing and tossing to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flaming circle of our life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When looking on their shaken hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dreaming how they dance and dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine eyes grow full of tender care:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beloved, gaze in thine own heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gaze no more in the bitter glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The demons, with their subtle guile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lift up before us when they pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or only gaze a little while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there a fatal image grows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With broken boughs, and blackened leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And roots half hidden under snows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Driven by a storm that ever grieves.</span>

					<span>For all things turn to barrenness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the dim glass the demons hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glass of outer weariness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made when God slept in times of old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, through the broken branches, go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ravens of unresting thought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peering and flying to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see men’s souls bartered and bought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they are heard upon the wind,</span>

					<span>Thy tender eyes grow all unkind:</span>

				<p>
					<span>The woods of Arcady are dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And over is their antique joy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of old the world on dreaming fed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gray Truth is now her painted toy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet still she turns her restless head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But O, sick children of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the many changing things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In dreary dancing past us whirled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Words alone are certain good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where are now the warring kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Word bemockers?—By the Rood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where are now the warring kings?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An idle word is now their glory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the stammering schoolboy said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reading some entangled story:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The kings of the old time are fled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wandering earth herself may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only a sudden flaming word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In clanging space a moment heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Troubling the endless reverie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then no wise worship dusty deeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor seek—for this is also sooth—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hunger fiercely after truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest all thy toiling only breeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No learning from the starry men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who follow with the optic glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whirling ways of stars that pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek, then—for this is also sooth—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No word of theirs: the cold star-bane</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dead is all their human truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, gather by the humming sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to its lips thy story tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they thy comforters will be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rewording in melodious guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy fretful words a little while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till they shall singing fade in ruth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And die a pearly brotherhood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For words alone are certain good:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sing, then, for this is also sooth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I must be gone: there is a grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where daffodil and lily wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I would please the hapless faun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Buried under the sleepy ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mirthful songs before the dawn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His shouting days with mirth were crowned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still I dream he treads the lawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walking ghostly in the dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pierced by my glad singing through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My songs of old earth’s dreamy youth:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fair are poppies on the brow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.</span>

				<p>
					<span>There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And humming sands, where windy surges wend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he called loudly to the stars to bend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried out, <i>Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled the persecution of her glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But naught they heard, for they are always listening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sought once again the shore, and found a shell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, <i>I will my heavy story tell</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>And my own tale again for me shall sing,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>And my own whispering words be comforting,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i>And lo! my ancient burden may depart</i>.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</span>

					<span>I passed along the water’s edge below the humid trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky.</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from his eye.</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide.</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brimful of starlight, and he said: <i>The Stamper of the Skies,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me?</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay,</i>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night</i>

					<span>I sat on cushioned otter skin:</span>

					<span>My word was law from Ith to Emen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shook at Invar Amargin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hearts of the world-troubling seamen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove tumult and war away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From girl and boy and man and beast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fields grew fatter day by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wild fowl of the air increased;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every ancient Ollave said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he bent down his fading head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He drives away the Northern cold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I sat and mused and drank sweet wine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A herdsman came from inland valleys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crying, the pirates drove his swine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I called my battle-breaking men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my loud brazen battle-cars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From rolling vale and rivery glen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And under the blinking of the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell on the pirates by the deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hurled them in the gulph of sleep:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These hands won many a torque of gold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But slowly, as I shouting slew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trampled in the bubbling mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In my most secret spirit grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A whirling and a wandering fire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood: keen stars above me shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around me shone keen eyes of men:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I laughed aloud and hurried on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By rocky shore and rushy fen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I laughed because birds fluttered by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rushes waved and waters rolled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now I wander in the woods</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When summer gluts the golden bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in autumnal solitudes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arise the leopard-coloured trees;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or when along the wintry strands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cormorants shiver on their rocks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wander on, and wave my hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing, and shake my heavy locks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grey wolf knows me; by one ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lead along the woodland deer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hares run by me growing bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I came upon a little town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That slumbered in the harvest moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And passed a-tiptoe up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring, to a fitful tune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I have followed, night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tramping of tremendous feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw where this old tympan lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deserted on a doorway seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bore it to the woods with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of some unhuman misery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our married voices wildly trolled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I sang how, when day’s toil is done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Orchil shakes out her long dark hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hides away the dying sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sheds faint odours through the air:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When my hand passed from wire to wire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It quenched, with sound like falling dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whirling and the wandering fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lift a mournful ulalu,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the kind wires are torn and still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I must wander wood and hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through summer’s heat and winter’s cold.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Good Father John O’Hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In penal days rode out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a shoneen who had free lands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his own snipe and trout.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In trust took he John’s lands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleiveens were all his race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he gave them as dowers to his daughters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they married beyond their place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Father John went up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Father John went down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he wore small holes in his shoes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he wore large holes in his gown.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All loved him, only the shoneen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom the devils have by the hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the wives, and the cats, and the children,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the birds in the white of the air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The birds, for he opened their cages</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he went up and down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he said with a smile, “Have peace now”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he went his way with a frown.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But if when any one died</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came keeners hoarser than rooks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bade them give over their keening;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was a man of books.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And these were the works of John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When weeping score by score,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>People came into Coloony;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he’d died at ninety-four.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There was no human keening;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The birds from Knocknarea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the world round Knocknashee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came keening in that day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The young birds and old birds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came flying, heavy and sad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keening in from Tiraragh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keening from Ballinafad;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Keening from Inishmurray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor stayed for bite or sup;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This way were all reproved</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who dig old customs up.</span>

					<span>But pity Moll Magee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My man was a poor fisher</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shore lines in the say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My work was saltin’ herrings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whole of the long day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sometimes from the saltin’ shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I scarce could drag my feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the blessed moonlight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the pebbly street.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’d always been but weakly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my baby was just born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A neighbour minded her by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I minded her till morn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I lay upon my baby;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye little childer dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I looked on my cold baby</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the morn grew frosty and clear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A weary woman sleeps so hard!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My man grew red and pale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave me money, and bade me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my own place, Kinsale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He drove me out and shut the door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave his curse to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I went away in silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No neighbour could I see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The windows and the doors were shut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One star shone faint and green;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The little straws were turnin’ round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the bare boreen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I went away in silence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond old Martin’s byre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a kindly neighbour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blowin’ her mornin’ fire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She drew from me my story—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My money’s all used up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still, with pityin’, scornin’ eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She gives me bite and sup.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She says my man will surely come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fetch me home agin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But always, as I’m movin’ round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without doors or within,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pilin’ the wood or pilin’ the turf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or goin’ to the well,</span>

					<span>I’m thinkin’ of my baby</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keenin’ to mysel’.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sometimes I am sure she knows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, openin’ wide His door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God lights the stars, His candles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And looks upon the poor.</span>

					<span>The sun upon all things that grow</span>

					<span>And now the old man’s dreams are gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He smooths the long brown nose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now moves many a pleasant tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his wasted hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For leading aged hounds and young</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The huntsman near him stands.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“My huntsman, Rody, blow the horn,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The huntsman loosens on the morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gay and wandering cry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A fire is in the old man’s eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fingers move and sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the wandering music dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They hear him feebly say,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“I cannot blow upon my horn,</span>

				<p>
					<span>The servants round his cushioned place</span>

				<span>And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>A rapturous music, till the morning break,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And him who drove the gods out of their liss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And till a hundred morns had flowered red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feasted and wept the barrows of his dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the proud dreaming king who flung the crown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sorrow away, and calling bard and clown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dwelt among wine-stained wanderers in deep woods;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him who sold tillage, and house, and goods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sought through lands and islands numberless years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until he found with laughter and with tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woman, of so shining loveliness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That men threshed corn at midnight by a tress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little stolen tress. I, too, await</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hour of thy great wind of love and hate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When shall the stars be blown about the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the sparks blown out of a smithy, and die?</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Old Age of Queen Maeve</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or on the benches underneath the walls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In comfortable sleep; all living slept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that great queen, who more than half the night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though now in her old age, in her young age</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She had been beautiful in that old way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s all but gone; for the proud heart is gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soft beauty and indolent desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She could have called over the rim of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever woman’s lover had hit her fancy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she’d had lucky eyes and a high heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sudden and laughing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dlx">O unquiet heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why do you praise another, praising her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if there were no tale but your own tale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who has been buried some two thousand years?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried from the porter’s lodge, and with long clamour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondering who of the many-changing Sidhe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had come as in the old times to counsel her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall, being old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that small chamber by the outer gate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The porter slept, although he sat upright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With still and stony limbs and open eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broke from his parted lips and broke again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shook him wide awake, and bid him say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who of the wandering many-changing ones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More still than they had been for a good month,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could remember when he had had fine dreams.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was before the time of the great war</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She turned away; he turned again to sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no god troubled now, and, wondering</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lifted the curtain of her sleeping-room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remembering that she too had seemed divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To many thousand eyes, and to her own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One that the generations had long waited</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That work too difficult for mortal hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought of days when he’d had a straight body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that famous Fergus, Nessa’s husband,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had been the lover of her middle life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not with his own voice or a man’s voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with the burning, live, unshaken voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of those that it may be can never age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “High Queen of Cruachan and Magh Ai,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with glad voice Maeve answered him, “What king</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the old days when they would come and go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About my threshold to counsel and to help.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parted lips replied, “I seek your help,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How may a mortal whose life gutters out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help them that wander with hand clasping hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their haughty images that cannot wither</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all their beauty’s like a hollow dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the cold North has troubled?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dlx">He replied:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am from those rivers and I bid you call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The children of the Maines out of sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set them digging into Anbual’s hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I helped your fathers when they built these walls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I would have your help in my great need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Queen of high Cruachan.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dlx">“I obey your will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our giver of good counsel and good luck.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a groan, as if the mortal breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could but awaken sadly upon lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That happier breath had moved, her husband turned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to the threshold of the painted house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the pillared dark began to stir</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She told them of the many-changing ones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that night, and all through the next day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To middle night, they dug into the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At middle night great cats with silver claws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With long white bodies came out of the air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Maines’ children dropped their spades, and stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With quaking joints and terror-strucken faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Maeve called out: “These are but common men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Maines’ children have not dropped their spades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because Earth, crazy for its broken power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Casts up a show and the winds answer it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With holy shadows.” Her high heart was glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the uproar ran along the grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She followed with light footfall in the midst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Friend of these many years, you too had stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With equal courage in that whirling rout;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For you, although you’ve not her wandering heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have all that greatness, and not hers alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there is no high story about queens</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In any ancient book but tells of you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when I’ve heard how they grew old and died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fell into unhappiness, I’ve said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“She will grow old and die, and she has wept!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when I’d write it out anew, the words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outrun the measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dlx">I’d tell of that great queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until two lovers came out of the air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With bodies made out of soft fire. The one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: “Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Maeve: “O Aengus, Master of all lovers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand years ago you held high talk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O when will you grow weary?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dlx">They had vanished;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But out of the dark air over her head there came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>That all things fell out happily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there, for all that fools had said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They found an old man running there:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had knees that stuck out of his hose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had puddle water in his shoes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had half a cloak to keep him dry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although he had a squirrel’s eye.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>
							<i>O wandering birds and rushy beds,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>You put such folly in our heads</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>With all this crying in the wind;</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>No common love is to our mind,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And our poor Kate or Nan is less</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Than any whose unhappiness</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Awoke the harp-strings long ago.</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Yet they that know all things but know</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>That all life had to give us is</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>A child’s laughter, a woman’s kiss.</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Who was it put so great a scorn</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>In the grey reeds that night and morn</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Are trodden and broken by the herds,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And in the light bodies of birds</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>That north wind tumbles to and fro</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And pinches among hail and snow?</i>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That runner said: “I am from the south;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I run to Baile Honey-Mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tell him how the girl Aillinn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rode from the country of her kin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And old and young men rode with her:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all that country had been astir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If anybody half as fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had chosen a husband anywhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But where it could see her every day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they had ridden a little way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An old man caught the horse’s head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With: ‘You must home again, and wed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With somebody in your own land.’</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A young man cried and kissed her hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘O lady, wed with one of us’;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when no face grew piteous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For any gentle thing she spake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She fell and died of the heart-break.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Because a lover’s heart’s worn out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Being tumbled and blown about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By its own blind imagining,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And will believe that anything</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is bad enough to be true, is true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Baile’s heart was broken in two;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he being laid upon green boughs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was carried to the goodly house</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where the Hound of Ulad sat before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brazen pillars of his door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His face bowed low to weep the end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the harper’s daughter and her friend.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For although years had passed away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He always wept them on that day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For on that day they had been betrayed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now that Honey-Mouth is laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under a cairn of sleepy stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before his eyes, he has tears for none,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Although he is carrying stone, but two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom the cairn’s but heaped anew.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>
							<i>We hold because our memory is</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>So full of that thing and of this</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>That out of sight is out of mind.</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>But the grey rush under the wind</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And the grey bird with crooked bill</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Have such long memories, that they still</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Remember Deirdre and her man;</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And when we walk with Kate or Nan</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>About the windy water side,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Our heart can hear the voices chide.</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>How could we be so soon content,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Who know the way that Naoise went?</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And they have news of Deirdre’s eyes,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Who being lovely was so wise—</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise.</i>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gathering his cloak about him, run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who amid leafy lights and shades</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dreamed of the hands that would unlace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their bodices in some dim place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they had come to the marriage bed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And harpers, pondering with bowed head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A music that had thought enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the ebb of all things to make love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow gentle without sorrowings;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leather-coated men with slings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who peered about on every side;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And amid leafy light he cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“He is well out of wind and wave;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They have heaped the stones above his grave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Muirthemne, and over it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In changeless Ogham letters writ—</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Baile, that was of Rury’s seed</i>.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“But the gods long ago decreed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No waiting maid should ever spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Baile and Aillinn’s marriage bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For they should clip and clip again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore it is but little news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That put this hurry in my shoes.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And hurrying to the south, he came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To that high hill the herdsmen name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Hill Seat of Leighin, because</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some god or king had made the laws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That held the land together there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In old times among the clouds of the air.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two swans came flying up to him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Linked by a gold chain each to each,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with low murmuring laughing speech</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alighted on the windy grass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They knew him: his changed body was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were hovering over the harp-strings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Etain, Midhir’s wife, had wove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the hid place, being crazed by love.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What shall I call them? fish that swim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scale rubbing scale where light is dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By a broad water-lily leaf;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forgotten at the threshing place;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or birds lost in the one clear space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of morning light in a dim sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or the door pillars of one house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That have one shadow on the ground;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or the two strings that made one sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where that wise harper’s finger ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For this young girl and this young man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have happiness without an end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because they have made so good a friend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They know all wonders, for they pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The towery gates of Gorias,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Findrias and Falias,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And long-forgotten Murias,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the giant kings whose hoard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wandering from broken street to street</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They come where some huge watcher is,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tremble with their love and kiss.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They know undying things, for they</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wander where earth withers away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though nothing troubles the great streams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But light from the pale stars, and gleams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the holy orchards, where there is none</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But fruit that is of precious stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or apples of the sun and moon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What were our praise to them? they eat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quiet’s wild heart, like daily meat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who when night thickens are afloat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On dappled skins in a glass boat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far out under a windless sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While over them birds of Aengus fly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over the tiller and the prow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And waving white wings to and fro</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaken wanderings of light air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stir their coverlet and their hair.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And poets found, old writers say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A yew tree where his body lay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But a wild apple hid the grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With its sweet blossom where hers was;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And being in good heart, because</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A better time had come again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After the deaths of many men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that long fighting at the ford,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wrote on tablets of thin board,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made of the apple and the yew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the love stories that they knew.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>
							<i>Let rush and bird cry out their fill</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Of the harper’s daughter if they will,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Beloved, I am not afraid of her.</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>She is not wiser nor lovelier,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>And you are more high of heart than she,</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>For all her wanderings over-sea;</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>But I’d have bird and rush forget</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Those other two; for never yet</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Has lover lived, but longed to wive</i>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<i>Like them that are no more alive.</i>

				<p>
					<span>We sat together at one summer’s end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you and I, and talked of poetry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I said: “A line will take us hours maybe;</span>

					<br/>

					<span>And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to articulate sweet sounds together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is to work harder than all these, and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be thought an idler by the noisy set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The martyrs call the world.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dlx">That woman then</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There’s many a one shall find out all heartache</span>

					<span>In finding that it’s young and mild and low:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There is one thing that all we women know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although we never heard of it at school—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we must labour to be beautiful.”</span>

					<span>Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There have been lovers who thought love should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much compounded of high courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they would sigh and quote with learned looks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Precedents out of beautiful old books;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We sat grown quiet at the name of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We saw the last embers of daylight die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the trembling blue-green of the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A moon, worn as if it had been a shell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the stars and broke in days and years.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I had a thought for no one’s but your ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you were beautiful, and that I strove</span>
					<br/>

					<span>The old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.</span>

					<span>I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Avalon the grass-green hollow, nor Joyous Isle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Ulad, when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon’s light and the sun’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long-lived ones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein are many queens like Branwen and Guinivere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Niamh and Laban and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wood-woman, whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the harp-string praise them, or hear their mournful talk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of a story I heard under the thin horn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>This book is, in part, a reprint of <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i>, printed a year ago on my sister's hand-press at Dundrum, Co. Dublin. I have not, however, reprinted a play which may be a part of a book of new plays suggested by the dance plays of Japan, and I have added a number of new poems. Michael Robartes and John Aherne, whose names occur in one or other of these, are characters in some stories I wrote years ago, who have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can alone express my convictions about the world. I have the fancy that I read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a disturbance at the first production of "The Play Boy," which may account for his animosity to myself.</p>

					<span>The trees are in their autumn beauty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woodland paths are dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the October twilight the water</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mirrors a still sky;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the brimming water among the stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are nine and fifty swans.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since I first made my count;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, before I had well finished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All suddenly mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scatter wheeling in great broken rings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon their clamorous wings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now my heart is sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first time on this shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bell-beat of their wings above my head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trod with a lighter tread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unwearied still, lover by lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They paddle in the cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Companionable streams or climb the air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their hearts have not grown old;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passion or conquest, wander where they will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attend upon them still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But now they drift on the still water</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mysterious, beautiful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among what rushes will they build,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By what lake's edge or pool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delight men's eyes, when I awake some day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find they have flown away?</span>

					<span>That she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird;</span>

					<span>And Ruth St. Denis had more charm although she had poor luck,</span>

					<span>From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova's had the cry,</span>

					<span>And there's a player in the States who gathers up her cloak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride</span>

					<span>With all a woman's passion, a child's imperious way,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There'll be that crowd to make men wild through all the centuries,</span>

					<span>Who is my beauty's equal, though that my heart denies,</span>
